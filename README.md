# FOCS
RPI FOCS, Foundation of Computer Science, CSCI 2200, DMC, Discrete Mathematics and Computing

I understand, the homework is difficult and time consuming, and there is not much resource because DMC is written by RPI professor, who does not release answer.
One way to overcome this is by archeiving past works. 

Please contribute your answers.
